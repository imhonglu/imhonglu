## About Me

Hello,

I am an experienced developer with 8 years in software development, specializing in TypeScript to build efficient and maintainable systems.

Previously, I worked as a backend developer at [Aha(a-ha)](https://www.a-ha.io/), where I designed and built API services supporting over 10 million monthly active users (MAU). I also introduced E2E testing, significantly improving service quality and stability, which enhanced both development efficiency and platform reliability.

Currently, I am developing [@imhonglu/json-schema](https://github.com/imhonglu/new-wheels/blob/main/libs/json-schema/README_KR.md), a JSON Schema 2020-12 Draft implementation.

This project combines runtime data validation with TypeScript type inference, enabling developers to leverage JSON Schema more safely and intuitively.
