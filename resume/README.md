## About Me

Hello.

I am a software developer with 8 years of experience, specializing in developing efficient and maintainable systems using TypeScript.

As a backend developer at [a-ha](https://www.a-ha.io/), I designed and built API services supporting over 10 million monthly active users (MAU). Additionally, I implemented E2E testing, significantly improving service quality and stability.

Currently, I am developing [@imhonglu/json-schema](https://github.com/imhonglu/new-wheels/blob/main/libs/json-schema/README.md), which implements the JSON Schema 2020-12 Draft specification. This project focuses on ensuring type safety through runtime data validation and TypeScript type inference, while enhancing developer experience through intuitive API design.
