## About Me

Hello,

I am a software developer with 8 years of experience, specializing in building efficient and maintainable systems using TypeScript.

Previously, I worked as a backend developer at [Aha (a-ha)](https://www.a-ha.io/), where I designed and built API services supporting over 10 million monthly active users (MAU).  
Additionally, I introduced end-to-end (E2E) testing, significantly improving service quality, reliability, and development efficiency.

Currently, I am developing [@imhonglu/json-schema](https://github.com/imhonglu/new-wheels/blob/main/libs/json-schema/README.md), an implementation of the JSON Schema 2020-12 Draft specification.  
This project combines runtime data validation with TypeScript type inference, enabling developers to utilize JSON Schema more safely and intuitively.
